# What is Fine Tuning?
Suppose you have a pre trained model like GPT4, GPT3.5, etc. Now imagine this model as a super smart student who has read the entire internet, but has never seen your specific textbook. Now you want this boy to have the complete understanding of your book too (that may be a medical book/engineering book/ anything other domain). What will you do? Option A: You will teach all the medical things to him. Option B: You will just give him the understanding of your book, ie teach your book. If you ask me, I will choose option B, because he already has all the knowledge available on internet (which includes medical too). I saved my time, energy and his time and enrgy too. Similarly, if I want GPT4 to be pro in law and orders, I give the model an additional understanding of law and order, not retrain it on law and order data again which will take huge time and resources.
