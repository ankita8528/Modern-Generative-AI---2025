# Introduction to Reasoning Models

Prompting is how we *interact* with LLMs, but **reasoning** is how LLMs *think*. While simple prompts can get basic answers, complex tasks like mathematical problem-solving, planning, or multi-hop question answering require models that can **simulate logical reasoning**.

In this section, we explore what reasoning models are, how they differ from traditional LLMs, and the core techniques that power them.

## What Are Reasoning Models?

Reasoning models are a class of LLMs (or enhanced LLM workflows) that go beyond text generation to perform **step-by-step thinking**, **decision-making**, and even **tool use**. These models don’t just generate text—they follow logical processes that mimic how humans reason.

Reasoning models are essential for tasks like:

- Solving multi-step math and logic problems  
- Analyzing and synthesizing knowledge  
- Interacting with tools, APIs, or memory modules  
- Building AI agents that can plan, reflect, and adapt  

---

## Why Do We Need Reasoning Models?

Standard LLMs are great at surface-level tasks (e.g., autocomplete, summaries), but they often:

- Struggle with multi-step reasoning  
- Make inconsistent or illogical inferences  
- Fail to use tools or memory effectively  

Reasoning techniques improve **accuracy**, **robustness**, and **generalization**, making LLMs useful in real-world scenarios like research assistants, coding agents, or AI tutors.

## Core Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 Step-by-step thinking | Uses explicit logic chains instead of a single output |
| 🔁 Reflection | Re-evaluates and corrects previous responses |
| 🛠 Tool-use | Integrates with search, code execution, or APIs |
| 🗺 Planning | Decomposes tasks into subtasks |
| 🌳 Exploration | Tries multiple reasoning paths before choosing the best |

## Key Reasoning Techniques

### 🔗 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Encourages the model to “think aloud” by writing intermediate steps before the final answer.  
**Use case:** Math problems, logical reasoning.

**Example:**

> Q: If a train leaves at 4 PM and travels 60 km/h for 2.5 hours, what time does it arrive?
> 
> A: The train travels for 2.5 hours starting from 4 PM. 2.5 hours after 4 PM is 6:30 PM.

---

### 🔁 2. Reflexion
The model generates an output, reflects on its correctness, and revises it if needed. This can be looped for continuous improvement.  
**Use case:** Decision-making, long-form tasks, code generation.

**Example:**

> Initial Response: The capital of Australia is Sydney.
> 
> Reflection: Wait, that's incorrect. Canberra is the actual capital.
> 
> Revised Response: The capital of Australia is Canberra.

---

### ⚙️ 3. ReAct (Reason + Act)
Combines reasoning (CoT) with tool use (e.g., search, calculator). The model decides when to reason and when to act.  
**Use case:** Agents, retrieval-augmented tasks.

**Example:**

> Q: What's the current temperature in Paris?
> 
> Model: Let's check the weather.
> 
> [Action: search("current temperature Paris")]
> 
> Observation: 23°C
> 
> Final Answer: The current temperature in Paris is approximately 23°C.

---

### 🌲 4. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
Explores multiple reasoning paths like a tree, scores them, and chooses the most optimal.  
**Use case:** Creative writing, complex planning, logic puzzles.

**Example:**

> Goal: Find the best way to spend 1 hour productively.
> 
> Thought 1: Watch an educational video → Gain knowledge.
> 
> Thought 2: Write a journal → Improve focus.
> 
> Thought 3: Take a walk → Improve health.
> 
> Evaluation: Thought 1 aligns with long-term learning goal.
> 
> Selected Path: Watch an educational video.

---

### 🧪 5. Self-Consistency
Instead of relying on one chain of thought, it samples multiple reasoning paths and picks the most consistent answer.  
**Use case:** Enhancing CoT reliability.

**Example:**

> Question: What is 24 × 17?
> 
> Sampled Answers:
> 
> 408
> 
> 408
> 
> 412
> 
> 408
> 
> Majority Vote: 408
> 
> Final Answer: 408

---

### 🧠 6. Program-Aided Language Models (PAL)
Uses code to solve logic or math-heavy problems. The LLM outputs a program that’s executed externally.  
**Use case:** Math, data analysis, algorithm design.

**Example:**

> Prompt: Write Python code to calculate the factorial of 5.
> 
> Generated Code:
> 
> def factorial(n):
> 
>   return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n - 1)
> 
>   factorial(5)
> 
> Execution Output: 120
> 
> Final Answer: 120

---

### 🔗 7. Prompt Chaining
Breaks a task into a series of smaller prompts, feeding the output of one into the next.  
**Use case:** Long pipelines, sequential reasoning, agents.

**Example:**

> Step 1 Prompt: Extract keywords from the sentence.
> Input: "LLMs are transforming modern AI applications."
> Output: ["LLMs", "modern AI", "applications"]
> Step 2 Prompt: Generate a tweet using these keywords.
> Output: "LLMs are driving the next wave of innovation in modern AI applications."
