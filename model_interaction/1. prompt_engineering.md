# Introduction to Prompt Engineering
We have seen what ***prompts*** are and why it is so important in the Generative AI field. Now we will be discussing what exactly is ***Prompt Engineering***, and what are the vwrious prompting tenchniques that are used. 
### Definition
Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs (prompts) to guide large language models (LLMs) like GPT/Claude to produce desired outputs.

Prompt Engineering is an emerging field focused on crafting and refining inputs to effectively harness the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across a broad range of applications.This skill set empowers practitioners to explore both the strengths and limitations of LLMs. For researchers, it serves as a way to boost safety and performance on tasks like reasoning and Q&A. Developers leverage prompt engineering to build reliable and efficient interfaces between language models and external systems or workflows.

This guide is designed to offer the theoretical understanding of Prompt Engineering, helping you get the most out of LLMs through smart, optimized prompting.

# Basics of Prompting
### Prompting an LLM
Even simple prompts can produce impressive results, but the output quality largely depends on how clearly the prompt is written and how much useful information it includes. A well-structured prompt typically consists of the task or question along with supporting details such as background context, input data, or illustrative examples. These components help guide the model more precisely and significantly enhance the relevance and accuracy of its responses.

Letâ€™s begin by looking at a basic example of a straightforward prompt:
Prompt:
> The sky is
Output:
> blue.
