# Introduction to Prompt Engineering
We have seen what ***prompts*** are and why it is so important in the Generative AI field. Now we will be discussing what exactly is ***Prompt Engineering***, and what are the vwrious prompting tenchniques that are used. 
### Definition
Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs (prompts) to guide large language models (LLMs) like GPT/Claude to produce desired outputs.

Prompt Engineering is an emerging field focused on crafting and refining inputs to effectively harness the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across a broad range of applications.This skill set empowers practitioners to explore both the strengths and limitations of LLMs. For researchers, it serves as a way to boost safety and performance on tasks like reasoning and Q&A. Developers leverage prompt engineering to build reliable and efficient interfaces between language models and external systems or workflows.

This guide is designed to offer the theoretical understanding of Prompt Engineering, helping you get the most out of LLMs through smart, optimized prompting.

# Basics of Prompting
### Prompting an LLM
Even simple prompts can produce impressive results, but the output quality largely depends on how clearly the prompt is written and how much useful information it includes. A well-structured prompt typically consists of the task or question along with supporting details such as background context, input data, or illustrative examples. These components help guide the model more precisely and significantly enhance the relevance and accuracy of its responses.

Let’s begin by looking at a basic example of a straightforward prompt:

Prompt:

> The sky is

Output:

> blue.

As seen in the example above, the language model generates a string of tokens that follow logically from the phrase "The sky is." However, the result may not always align with your intended task or goal. This simple case illustrates the importance of including clearer context or more specific instructions to guide the model’s behavior effectively. That’s the essence of prompt engineering—shaping your inputs to produce more accurate and useful outputs.

Let’s refine the prompt a little:

Prompt:

> Complete the sentence: 
The sky is

Output:

> blue during the day and dark at night.

Looks better, right? In this revised prompt, you’re clearly guiding the model to complete a sentence, and the output aligns much more closely with your intent. This kind of precise instruction is the core idea behind prompt engineering—crafting inputs that clearly communicate the task you want the model to perform.

This simple example barely scratches the surface of what modern LLMs can do. Today’s models are capable of handling a wide range of complex tasks, from summarizing lengthy articles to solving math problems and writing code.

# Prompt Formatting
A typical prompt can either be a question:

> What is Deep Learning?

Or an instruction:

> Explain artificial intelligence in simple terms.

You can also use Q&A format, which is useful in many tasks:

> Q: What is Deep Learning?
> A:

This is called zero-shot prompting, where you give no examples, just a direct task. Many more prompting techniques are there, which we are going to discuss next.

# Commonly Used Prompting Techniques
Large Language Models (LLMs) can be guided in various ways, depending on the task. Below are the most widely adopted and practical prompting techniques used in real-world AI systems today:

### 1. Zero-shot prompting 
We have seen earlier.

### 2. Few-shot Prompting
In few-shot prompting, you provide a few demonstrations (input-output pairs) to show the model what kind of response you expect. This helps the model understand the task better, especially for classification, translation, or structured responses.
For example:

> Translate to French:  
> Good morning. → Bonjour  
> How are you? → Comment ça va?  
> I am happy. →

### 3. Chain-of-Thought(CoT) Prompting
CoT prompting encourages the model to reason step-by-step. It’s useful for solving math problems, logical puzzles, or multi-step decision making.
Example:

> Q: If there are 5 birds and 3 fly away, how many are left?  
> A: First, there are 5 birds. Then 3 fly away. So, 5 - 3 = 2. The answer is 2.

### 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This combines prompt engineering with retrieval systems. You fetch relevant documents or data from external sources and include them in the prompt, giving the model grounded context to improve accuracy.

Used in: ChatGPT with browsing, Perplexity AI, custom enterprise agents.

### 5. Prompt Chaining
Here, multiple prompts are connected step-by-step to solve a larger task. Each prompt handles a sub-task, and the output is passed to the next stage.

Use Case: Generate → Summarize → Analyze → Visualize.

### 6. ReAct (Reason + Act)
This technique mixes reasoning and tool use. The model is prompted to reflect, take action (like search or calculation), and respond based on the result.

Example Flow: Think → Search → Answer

### 6. Reflexion
Reflexion is a prompting method where the model is encouraged to evaluate and reflect on its own previous responses, identify mistakes or shortcomings, and then revise its output. This is inspired by how humans learn—by reflecting on what went wrong and trying again with improved strategies.

How it works:
1. The model attempts to solve a problem.
2. It then generates a self-evaluation or critique of its solution.
3. Based on this reflection, it tries again with an improved or corrected approach.

Example:
Prompt: “Write a Python function to reverse a string.”
Model Output: def reverse(s): return s
Self-Reflection Prompt: “Does the above function correctly reverse a string? If not, what’s wrong?”
Reflexion Output: “The function only returns the string as-is. It should reverse it. Let's correct it.”
Revised Output: def reverse(s): return s[ : :-1]

### Other Techniques (Used in Research / Advanced Systems)
7. Meta Prompting – Prompt the model to write a better prompt.
8. Self-Consistency – Sample multiple CoT outputs and pick the best.
9. Tree of Thoughts – Explore multiple reasoning paths.
10. Program-Aided LMs – Combine code logic with text reasoning.
11. Active-Prompt / Automatic Prompt Engineer – AI optimizes the prompt for you.
12. Multimodal CoT – Reasoning across text + image + audio inputs.
13. Graph Prompting – For tasks involving structured graph-based thinking.
14. Directional Stimulus Prompting – Control tone/intent using prompt cues.
