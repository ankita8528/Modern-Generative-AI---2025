# Introduction to Prompt Engineering
We have seen what ***prompts*** are and it the so important in the Generative AI field. Now we will be discussing what exactly is ***Prompt Engineering***, and what are the vwrious prompting tenchniques that are used. 
### Definition
Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs (prompts) to guide large language models (LLMs) like GPT/Claude to produce desired outputs.

Prompt Engineering is an emerging field focused on crafting and refining inputs to effectively harness the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across a broad range of applications.This skill set empowers practitioners to explore both the strengths and limitations of LLMs. For researchers, it serves as a way to boost safety and performance on tasks like reasoning and Q&A. Developers leverage prompt engineering to build reliable and efficient interfaces between language models and external systems or workflows.

This guide is designed to offer the theoretical understanding of Prompt Engineering, helping you get the most out of LLMs through smart, optimized prompting.
