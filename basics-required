# Generative AI — Basics

Before diving into the building blocks of Generative AI, it's important to establish a strong foundation — especially for those who are new to the field or coming from a Machine Learning background.

This document covers the key concepts you need to understand before jumping into advanced topics like Prompt Engineering, RAG, Agents, and Fine-Tuning.

### What is Generative AI?
A system that can generate new data based on training sample (similar as the input/independent features in Machine Learning). Generative models can generate image, text, audio, video, etc. data as output.
#### Key Types:
- **Generative Image Models** – Generate realistic or artistic images.
- **Generative Language Models (LLMs)** – Generate coherent and contextual text.

### What is LLM?
LLM stands for Large Language Model (Generative Language Model) that generates text. Examples of LLMs - ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Meta Llama, DeepSeek, Claude etc. Similar to a Machine Learning model, we need to train an LLM also and for that we need to provide huge amount of sequential (text based) data. After the LLM gets trained on the data we can ask the LLM to generate any kind of text, and the "ask" thing is nothing but "Prompt".
So, now that we have read the basic required things, we can proceed with the first building block of Generative AI - Prompt Engineering.
