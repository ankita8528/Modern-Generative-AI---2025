# AI Building Blocks for Generative AI Systems

Welcome to the ultimate resource for understanding and mastering the **building blocks of modern Generative AI**. This repository contains categorized documents, guides, and hands-on code to help you navigate the GenAI ecosystem—from foundational concepts to production-ready systems.

---

## What's Inside?

This repo is structured around the **core categories of GenAI building blocks**, each with its own directory of detailed explanations, diagrams, and references.

---

### 1. Model Interaction & Reasoning
- **Prompt Engineering**  
- **Reasoning Models** (CoT, ReAct, Toolformer, etc.)  
- **Model Fine-Tuning** (Full, LoRA, QLoRA)

📁 `/model-interaction`

---

### 2. Agentic Layer
- **Agentic Frameworks** (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen)
- **Agentic Browser / Computer Use** (Auto-GPT, OpenDevin)
- **MCP (Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol)**

📁 `/agents`

---

### 3. Knowledge & Retrieval Layer
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
- **Embedding / Vector DB** (FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma)  
- **Graph DB Usage with LLMs** (Neo4j, TigerGraph)  
- **Data Extraction** (Preprocessing, Chunking, PDF/HTML parsing)

📁 `/knowledge-retrieval`

---

### 4. Multimodal Interfaces
- **Voice Stack**  
  - Speech-to-Text (Whisper, Deepgram)  
  - Text-to-Speech (ElevenLabs, Azure, Bark)

📁 `/multimodal`

---

### 5. Evaluation & Safety
- **Evals** (OpenAI Evals, TruLens, custom scoring)  
- **Guardrails** (Guardrails.ai, Rebuff, safety prompts)

📁 `/evals-guardrails`

---

### 6. System Design & Infrastructure
- **Async Programming** (for fast LLM agent orchestration)
- Infrastructure best practices (caching, scaling, deployment)

📁 `/infra`
