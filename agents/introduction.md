# From Fine-Tuning to Agentic Thinking

Last time, we looked at fine-tuning â€” shaping an LLMâ€™s knowledge and behavior for a specific task.
But hereâ€™s the catch: even the most perfectly fine-tuned model is still reactive.
It answers when asked, but it doesnâ€™t act unless told.

So, what if we could take that same LLMâ€¦ and give it the ability to:

+ Plan ahead
+ Use external tools
+ Remember past interactions
+ Decide its own next step

Thatâ€™s where we step into the Agentic Layer.

# The Agentic Layer â€“ Teaching AI to Act

Think of the Agentic Layer as the operating system for your AI.
Here, the LLM isnâ€™t just predicting the next word â€” itâ€™s thinking about the next move.
It can choose to search the web, query a database, run a script, or talk to another agent.

To make this happen, we use Agentic Frameworks â€” specialized toolkits that turn a static model into a decision-making system.
They handle the heavy lifting:

+ Managing reasoning steps
+ Integrating with APIs
+ Storing and recalling memory
+ Handling multi-step goals

# ðŸ”— Why Weâ€™re Starting with LangChain

There are many frameworks out there â€” CrewAI, AutoGen, and more â€” but weâ€™ll start with LangChain because itâ€™s like the Swiss Army knife of agent building.

With LangChain, you can:

+ Build chains (sequences of reasoning steps)
+ Create agents that can decide their own actions
+ Add memory for continuity
+ Give your AI tools to interact with the outside world

In other words, weâ€™ll take what we learned in fine-tuning and put it inside a framework that makes the AI not just knowledgeableâ€¦ but capable.

Next up: Weâ€™ll start small â€” connecting a fine-tuned model to LangChain and giving it its first tool. This is where theory starts turning into something that feels alive.
